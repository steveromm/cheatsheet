# Cheatsheet

My personal Web Developer cheatsheet page which started as a Codecademy project and transformed into a general purpose reference guide with practice spaces for concepts and designs learned in my Codecademy Full-Stack Developer course. I use this site to practice coding, git and github as well I'm even using it at this very moment to practice my markdown language for this README.

I will continue to update this page as I learn more concepts from Codecademy.

## Features

- Display & Positioning Terms
- Grid Terms & Practice
- Flexbox Terms & Pracice

## Uses

It can be easy to forget coding lessons without practice, so each section has a practice space for working with code learned in that lesson to see results.

## Technologies

Currently, this site utilizes HTML, CSS, Git and Github, but as I learn new languages and concepts they will be added as well. I'm looking at you, Javascript!
